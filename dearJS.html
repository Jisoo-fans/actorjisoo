					Dear Ji Soo, 
						<br/>I hope you are doing well. I really want to remind you that you are loved dearly by many people. I think it is important for me to explain why I am supporting you, it is not because I have "Oppa" symdrome,
						it is because I believe in you and second chances. I see you as a good young man that regrets some of your actions in the past and you are humble enough to put everything you have worked really hard for on the line to apologies 
						for any hurt you might have caused others in the past! That is super brave and deserves recognition and respect! 
						<br/>
					</br>
						<!-- So please know that I will continue to suport you and help you in any way while you face this mountain. (please remember this is very human - we all make mistakes and have regrets)  -->
						It's important to remember that although it seems super dark right now dawn is on its way and you will surely come out on the other side of this storm! We are many and we are with you no matter what. 
						 What is going on right now is scary and I am unsure what your support system looks like but a lot of us are here to talk at any time! 
						 <!-- You are the first celebrity I am investing this much time and energy in, if you knew me you will understand wy this is a big deal for . -->
						We will continue to support you no matter what you choice to do before and after your enlistment! We will defend you when others try to disrepect you! We will cheer you on when you need our support and affection. We are here for you!
						
						<!-- I support you not because I am naive but because I am smart enough to understand that we are humans 
						and none of us is perfect. We humans can be so cruel that we will make up a lie to ruin someone else life just because they are more successful than us.  -->
						</br>
					</br>
						Don't be discouraged, you have been blessed to know the real faces of your true friends, fans and supporter! You now know the people standing beside you now are the real deal and everyone else that fell away and believed everything they saw online were never truly 
						with you. 
					</br>
				</br>
						Ji Soo, RAISE YOUR HEAD UP HIGH, STAND TALL and soldier on! Your FUTURE is bright and waiting for you! Don't ever give up hope! You are talented and no one can take away your talent or your spirit or your joy.
						
						I will continue to wait for you.
